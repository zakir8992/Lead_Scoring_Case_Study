# X EDUCATION Lead Scoring Case Study
## Problem Statement:
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.Â Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%
The CEO has set a target lead conversion rate of 80%. The lead scoring model should help the sales team to prioritize potential leads that have a higher conversion chance and enable them to focus on communicating with them. 

## Goals of the Case Study:
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so need to handle these as well
